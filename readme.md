# Soft matter and solid state physics

This is repository contains my notes for the course [PHYS-F308](https://www.ulb.be/fr/programme/phys-f308-1), given in the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles during the academic year 2022-2023.

This course consists of two different, but complementary courses. One treats of soft matter physics whereas the second part treats of solid state physics.
